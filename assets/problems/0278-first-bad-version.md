# First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

## Code Template

### Go
```go
/** 
 * Forward declaration of isBadVersion API.
 * @param   version   your guess about first bad version
 * @return 	 	      true if current version is bad 
 *			          false if current version is good
 * func isBadVersion(version int) bool;
 */

func firstBadVersion(n int) int {
    
}
```

### TypeScript
```typescript
/**
 * The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
 * isBadVersion(version: number): boolean {
 *     ...
 * };
 */

var solution = function(isBadVersion: any) {

    return function(n: number): number {
        
    };
};
```
